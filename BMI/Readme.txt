# BMI Prediction and Analysis Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict BMI (Body Mass Index) based on various features and creating a web-based dashboard to visualize insights from the data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict BMI values using a machine learning model and provide a dashboard for visualizing essential trends and predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals, including features like age, height, weight, and gender. The goal is to predict BMI based on these features.

## Data Analysis

The data was initially analyzed to understand its structure and characteristics. The Jupyter Notebook file `File.ipynb` contains step-by-step analysis and cleaning processes. Key steps include:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify relationships and trends

## Machine Learning Model

A Linear Regression model was chosen for predicting BMI. The Jupyter Notebook file `File.ipynb` contains the steps to:

- Preprocess the data for training
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared
- Save the trained model as `BMI.pkl`

## Dashboard

A simple web-based dashboard was created using Plotly and Dash to visualize insights from the data and model predictions. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations and model prediction inputs.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks directory for data analysis and model training.
3. Use the trained model and dashboard to predict and visualize BMI.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Plotly
- Dash
